Optimizing these properties can significantly enhance nanofluid performance. This study introduces a hybrid strategy based on computational intelligence to determine the optimal conditions for ternary hybrid nanofluids. The goal is to minimize dynamic viscosity and maximize thermal conductivity by varying the volume fraction, temperature, and nanomaterial mixing ratio. The proposed strategy integrates machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and multi-criteria decision-making. Three machine learning techniques—GMDH-type neural network, gene expression programming, and combinatorial algorithm—are applied to model dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity as functions of the input variables. Then, the high-performing models provide the foundation for optimization using the well-established multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, the decision-making technique TOPSIS is employed to identify the most desirable points from the Pareto front, based on various design scenarios. To validate the proposed strategy, a ternary hybrid nanofluid composed of graphene oxide (GO), iron oxide (Fe₃O₄), and titanium dioxide (TiO₂) was employed as a case study. The results demonstrated that the combinatorial approach excelled in accurately modeling (R = 0.99964–0.99993). The optimization process revealed that optimal VFs span a broad range across all mixing ratios, while optimal temperatures were consistently near the maximum value (65 °C). The decision-making outcomes indicated that the mixing ratio was consistent across all design scenarios, with the volume fraction serving as the key differentiating factor. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computational Intelligence; Machine Learning; Multi-criteria Decision-making; Multi-objective Optimization; Ternary Hybrid Nanofluid; Thermophysical Properties; Iron Oxide; Graphene Oxide; Iron Oxide; Nanofluid; Nanomaterial; Adult; Algorithm; Article; Controlled Study; Decision Making; Gene Expression; Human; Hybrid; Intelligence; Machine Learning; Multicriteria Decision Analysis; Multiobjective Optimization; Nerve Cell Network; Particle Swarm Optimization; Pharmaceutics; Technique For Order Preference By Similarity To Ideal Solution; Temperature; Thermal Conductivity; Viscosity,graphene oxide; iron oxide; nanofluid; nanomaterial; adult; algorithm; article; controlled study; decision making; gene expression; human; hybrid; intelligence; machine learning; multicriteria decision analysis; multiobjective optimization; nerve cell network; particle swarm optimization; pharmaceutics; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; temperature; thermal conductivity; viscosity,Nature Research,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215960393,0,"optimizing ternary hybrid nanofluids using neural networks, gene expression programming, and multi-objective particle swarm optimization: a computational intelligence strategy the performance of nanofluids is largely determined by their thermophysical properties. optimizing these properties can significantly enhance nanofluid performance. this study introduces a hybrid strategy based on computational intelligence to determine the optimal conditions for ternary hybrid nanofluids. the goal is to minimize dynamic viscosity and maximize thermal conductivity by varying the volume fraction, temperature, and nanomaterial mixing ratio. the proposed strategy integrates machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and multi-criteria decision-making. three machine learning techniques—gmdh-type neural network, gene expression programming, and combinatorial algorithm—are applied to model dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity as functions of the input variables. then, the high-performing models provide the foundation for optimization using the well-established multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. finally, the decision-making technique topsis is employed to identify the most desirable points from the pareto front, based on various design scenarios. to validate the proposed strategy, a ternary hybrid nanofluid composed of graphene oxide (go), iron oxide (fe₃o₄), and titanium dioxide (tio₂) was employed as a case study. the results demonstrated that the combinatorial approach excelled in accurately modeling (r = 0.99964–0.99993). the optimization process revealed that optimal vfs span a broad range across all mixing ratios, while optimal temperatures were consistently near the maximum value (65 °c). the decision-making outcomes indicated that the mixing ratio was consistent across all design scenarios, with the volume fraction serving as the key differentiating factor. © 2025 elsevier b.v., all rights reserved. computational intelligence; machine learning; multi-criteria decision-making; multi-objective optimization; ternary hybrid nanofluid; thermophysical properties; iron oxide; graphene oxide; iron oxide; nanofluid; nanomaterial; adult; algorithm; article; controlled study; decision making; gene expression; human; hybrid; intelligence; machine learning; multicriteria decision analysis; multiobjective optimization; nerve cell network; particle swarm optimization; pharmaceutics; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; temperature; thermal conductivity; viscosity graphene oxide; iron oxide; nanofluid; nanomaterial; adult; algorithm; article; controlled study; decision making; gene expression; human; hybrid; intelligence; machine learning; multicriteria decision analysis; multiobjective optimization; nerve cell network; particle swarm optimization; pharmaceutics; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; temperature; thermal conductivity; viscosity",Graphene + Fe₃O₄ + TiO₂,,,

This study investigates bioconvection flow and its heat transfer characteristics of the magnetohydrodynamic ternary hybrid nanofluid containing silver, copper, and aluminum nanoparticles with human blood.

The hybrid nanofluid's improved thermal behavior is a key focus. It is found that the increasing sheet thickness leads to higher temperatures, while velocity and concentration drop. Greater thermal radiation and more silicon dioxide particles enhance the heat transfer, improving efficiency by 12% and reducing drag (skin friction) by 15% under optimized conditions.

Moreover, the flow is under the influence of thermal radiation, MHD, variable thermal conductivity kthnfT, stretchable–shrinkable inclined walls and temperature jump effects. In this situation, there are nanoparticles considered (i.e., Fe3O4-ZnO-UO2). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms by which hybrid nanofluids influence the skin friction coefficient (Cf) and heat transfer characteristics inside magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems. Additionally, a rise in the amount of hybrid nanofluids results in an increase in the viscosity, which in turn results in an increase in the skin friction coefficient. However, at the same time, the skin friction coefficient reduces as the Hartmann number values grow because turbulence decreases in proportion to the increase. The findings of the research demonstrate that the concentration of hybrid nanofluids and the intensity of magnetic fields interact in a complex way to impact fluid dynamics. According to the results of the study, optimizing the management of these parameters so as to minimize friction loss and maximize the performance of MHD applications is necessary. This research study provides quantitative and qualitative outcomes that improve comprehension of MHD hybrid nanofluid applications in practical settings. Analysis results demonstrate that the skin friction coefficient (Cf) together with Nusselt number (Nu) increases substantially as Reynolds number reaches 210 through optimal conditions when using 6% hybrid nanofluid concentration.

The primary objective is to analyze how key parameters, such as the Reynolds number (Re), Hartmann number (Ha), Lewis number (Le) and obstacle positioning, influence hydrodynamic forces (drag and lift coefficients), heat and mass transfer and flow stability. The study aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing thermal management systems, enhancing microfluidic device performance and advancing biomedical applications involving hybrid nanofluids and non-Newtonian fluids. Design/methodology/approach: The governing equations for mass, momentum, energy and solute transport are solved using a high-order finite element method (FEM), with nonlinearities addressed via Newton’s method. Time integration is carried out using a nonstationary scheme based on the backward differentiation formula (BDF). The model accounts for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, thermal radiation and the rheological behavior of Casson fluid. The numerical implementation is validated against experimental data and benchmark solutions prior to performing the simulations. Findings: Key results show that the ternary hybrid nanofluid enhances heat transfer, with a 1.03% increase in the Nusselt number, while the Casson fluid reduces drag and stabilizes flow reattachment. Increasing Re enlarges recirculation zones but decreases the drag coefficient ((Formula presented.)) by 95%. In contrast, higher Ha increases (Formula presented.) by 92% due to Lorentz forces. Obstacle positioning significantly alters hydrodynamic forces, with minimal (Formula presented.) at (Formula presented.) and maximum shear-induced drag at (Formula presented.). The lift coefficient ((Formula presented.)) transitions nonmonotonically with (Formula presented.), and magnetic fields redistribute pressure, amplifying (Formula presented.). Originality/value: This work’s novelty lies in its holistic analysis of ternary hybrid ferrofluids with Casson fluid behavior in an MHD-driven BFS flow, a configuration unexplored in prior studies. The integration of radiative heat transfer, thermosolutal convection and non-Newtonian effects under transient conditions offers new insights into flow-thermal-stability tradeoffs. Practical value emerges from parametric optimizations (e.g. obstacle positioning for minimal drag, Ha-dependent vortex control) applicable to microfluidic cooling, targeted drug delivery and energy systems. The validated high-order FEM framework also advances computational methods for complex multiphysics flows. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Backward-facing Step; Casson Fluid; Double Diffusion;

Numerous applications have found Casson fluids to be one of the most commonly used non-Newtonian fluids. This study analyzes the variational influence of linear and nonlinear thermal radiation on Casson ternary hybrid nanofluid flow through an inclined micro-porous channel. The modeled equations for the flow system of the Casson ternary hybrid nanofluid Al2O3-TiO2-CuO-C2H6O2 were numerically analyzed using the Chebyshev collocation technique to scrutinize the impacts of different associated physical flow parameters including Hartmann number, Casson parameter, thermal radiation parameter, Forchheimer coefficient, Darcy number, heat source parameter, nanoparticles volume fraction, and Brinkmann number, on the velocity field, temperature profile, and entropy generation, illustrated through graphs and tables taking Rosseland’s linear and nonlinear heat flux into consideration. The iterative computations were done using a developed pseudocode implemented on the Wolfram language tool MATHEMATICA 11.0 software.

The primary goal is to assess the implication of Joule heating, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), thermal radiation, and boundary slips on the physical quantities and flow profiles. Besides, attention is also given to the occurrences of multiple solutions in this fluid flow situation. The continuity, momentum and energy equations that described the fluid flow problem are converted into a simpler form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is achieved by applying a similarity transformation, which make the equations easier to solve. Solving the resulting equations using the bvp4c solver in MATLAB software yields results that are analyzed and illustrated through a combination of tables and graphical representations. The analysis reveals that, for a shrinking sheet, an increase in Joule heating reduces the heat transfer. Similarly, a higher thermal slip factor leads to a decreased heat transfer rate in this case. In contrast, parameters such as magnetic field strength, radiation, velocity slip and suction contribute to enhancing the heat transfer rate of THNF. Furthermore, the results indicate that the THNF used in this study exhibits a better heat transfer rate compared to nanofluid (NF) and hybrid nanofluid (HNF). Notably, a shrinking sheet is observed to exhibit multiple solutions when the shrinking parameter falls within a defined range, specifically when λ>λc.

Nanofluids, engineered by dispersing nanoparticles within a base fluid, have emerged as a promising medium to augment heat transfer capabilities. This investigation delves into the intricate dynamics of a three-dimensional natural convective Ternary Hybrid Nanofluid (THNF) flow across a stretching sheet. The nanofluid comprises a water Base Fluid (BF) fortified with a multilateral mixture of CuO, MgO, and TiO2 nanoparticles. To capture the complexities of the system, a mathematical model incorporating multiple slip conditions, a variable heat source (temperature-dependent and exponentially varying in space), nonlinear thermal radiation, and the influence of a magnetic field is developed. The subsequent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are transformed into a dimensionless form through suitable similarity transformations, yielding a system of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). These equations are then numerically addressed using the sophisticated Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation Scheme (L-MBPS) integrated with Artificially Intelligent Neural Networks (AI-NNs). The performance of the proposed AI-NNs with L-MBPS is evaluated through a series of performance metrics. Mean Squared Error (M2E), Histogram Error Analysis (HEA), and Regression Analysis Plots (RAPs) are employed to assess model accuracy under varying conditions. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of pertinent parameters on velocity and temperature profiles is conducted. Results disclose that x-direction velocity slip exerts a decelerating influence on the fluid flow, while an intensifying stretching ratio diminishes the momentum distribution.

Scholars may discover novel perspectives for increasing heat transfer performance, establishing advanced materials, and enhancing the efficiency of multiple engineering systems by studying the behavior of CYNF in this particular instance. The energy transfer through trihybrid CYNF flow with the effect of magnetic dipole across a stretching sheet is examined in the present study. The ternary hybrid nanofluid (THNF) has been prepared by the addition of ternary nanoparticles (NPs) in the water (50%) and ethylene glycol (50%). Titanium dioxide (TiO2), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) are used in base fluid. The fluid velocity and heat transfer are examined under the impact of Darcy–Forchheimer, chemical reaction, convective condition, activation energy, and exponential heat source. The fluid flow has been stated in form of velocity, energy, and concentration equations. The set of modeled equations is simplified to non-dimensional form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by using similarity substitutions. Numerically, the system of lowest order ODEs is calculated through the parametric continuation method.

Velocity profile decreases and temperature profile increases for variable viscosity parameter. Higher Eckert number and radiation parameter values boost thermal profiles, according to our research. Temperature distribution decreased as magnetic and suction parameters increased. Both the Eckert number and the thermal stratification parameter have a negative correlation with the Nusselt number. Compared to conventional fluids, nanofluids enhance the Nusselt number of nanofluids by roughly 10.2%, hybrid nanofluids by around 19.8%, and ternary hybrid nanofluids by about 38.05% when the parameter S is set from 2.0 to 2.4 with nanoparticles of 0.01.

This heightened efficiency makes nanofluids invaluable in enhancing the performance of cooling systems, heating processes, and thermal management applications. Keeping in view these important applications, this study involves the analysis of ternary hybrid nanofluid containing Cu, TiO2, and SiO2 in water on a porous stretchy three-dimensional surface incorporating thermal radiation, thermophoretic forces, chemical reaction, Joule heating with convective and mass flux conditions. The leading equations rendered to dimensionless notation through the application of similarity transformation. Subsequently, the solution to the transformed equation is acquired using the bvp4c method. As outcome of the work, an elevated thermophoresis factor leads to an expansion of the concentration, whereas a lessening tendency is noted for Schmidt number, Brownian motion and chemical reactivity factor. The thermal efficiency of the ternary nanofluid is enhanced by factors such as thermophoresis thermal radiation, Biot number, Eckert number, and magnetic field. The computed estimates of drag force at surface reveal the impact of various parameters, indicating that an increase in the porosity parameter leads to a reduction in the surface drag force in x- as well as y- directions. Conversely, advancement in the magnetic factor causes an escalation in surface drags force along the y- direction. Higher Biot number and radiation parameter values enhance the heat transference proportion, whereas higher Brownian motion, thermophoresis, and Eckert number decrease the thermal flow rate. Additionally, escalation in chemical reaction, Schmidt number, and Brownian motions enhances the mass transfer rate. The numerical code for this work has satisfactory promise with the already published work. The insights gained from this analysis can be applied to enhance the efficiency of engineering processes where convective heat transfer is a critical factor, thereby improving the performance of various applications like cooling systems, heat exchangers, and other thermal management systems.

Results reveal that blade-shaped nanoparticles significantly enhance the phase transition rate of paraffin, achieving an average phase transition of 81.97 % at Reynolds number 50 and 10 % volume fraction. Furthermore, the temperature variation along the PCM block shows rapid behavior with blade-shaped particles. Optimal electrical efficiency, reaching a peak of 9.42 %, is observed at Reynolds number 150 and 10 % volume fraction with blade-shaped nanoparticles. The study underscores the importance of nanoparticle shape and volume fraction in improving PV/T system performance. The findings recommend blade-shaped nanoparticles and higher nanofluid volume fractions to maximize electrical efficiency.

Therefore, this study examines the effects of porous medium, thermal radiation, magnetic effect, and external pollutants in a water-based ternary hybrid nanofluid flow within the context of the Reiner-Philippoff fluid model. The suitable similarity transformations are utilized to transform the partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The resulting set of ODEs are solved numerically to find the solutions using the function bvp4c available in MATLAB software. The ternary hybrid nanofluid (Ag-Cu-TiO2) significantly enhances heat and mass transfer rates by about 42.72 % and 2.53 % compared to water (H2O) at around 4.36 % and 0.60 % relative to the hybrid nanofluid (Ag-TiO2), respectively. In pollutant-free conditions, the heat and mass transfer of ternary hybrid nanofluid (Ag-Cu-TiO2) progresses up to 0.34 % and 0.26 %, respectively, compared to H2O. Meanwhile, for hybrid nanofluid (Ag-TiO2), it develops by about 0.24 % and 0.31 %, respectively. This indicates that the impact of the external pollutants significantly delays mass transfer but increases the concentration field and destabilizes the flow near the shrinking sheet. Trio slip parameters reduce shear stress, heat, and mass transfer rates, while the mixed convection parameter enhances the skin friction coefficient in the assisting flow and diminishes it in the opposing flow. The magnetic parameter enlarges shear stress with the help of the Lorentz force but thermal radiation increases the heat transfer rate while reducing surface drag. Additionally, nanoparticle volume fractions and the porous medium elevate shear stress and heat transfer rate.

It examines the impact of nanoparticle shape factor and irreversibility on suspensions containing Al2O3, CuO, and ZnO nanoparticles in water. Different physical and thermal conditions are taken into account, such as porous medium, suction/injection, radiation, heat source/sink, variable viscosity and thermal conductivity. Ternary hybrid nanofluids exhibit better thermophysical stability and performance than traditional nanofluids. The application of ternary hybrid nanofluids in rotating systems with two parallel stretching surfaces has industrial applications such as material treatment, manufacturing processes, and cooling systems. By introducing similarity variables, the governing partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations, which are then solved numerically using the Keller Box Method based on implicit finite differences. The study finds that as the viscosity parameter increases, there is a decrease in fluid velocity and an increase in temperature. Additionally, increasing values of radiation and thermal conductivity parameter lead to enhanced temperature and entropy generation rate. The entropy generation rate is higher for platelet-shaped nanoparticles and lower for spherical-shaped nanoparticles.

Their unique properties make them suitable for diverse applications, ranging from heat exchangers to advanced industrial and medical treatments. Due to the practical applications and innovative features of THNFs, this paper aims to analyze the performance of these fluids to improve the efficiency of modern devices. The THNF is formulated by adding nanoparticles of three different kinds of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and copper (Cu) into water (H2O) based ethylene glycol (C2H6O2). The momentum equation is formulated considering the influences of Darcy Forchheimer, permeability, and magnetic field. Thermal radiation, intermolecular friction force, and Joule heating effects are accounted in the thermal field equation. Mass concentration relation is acquired considering binary chemical reaction and activation energy (AE). Additionally, the influence of stratifications (thermal and solutal) at the boundary of the cylinder is considered. The physical phenomenon representing partial differential equations is reduced into ordinary ones utilizing the transformations and then solved via Runge–Kutta Fehlberg (RKF-45) numerical scheme in Mathematics. Influence of involved sundry variables on HNF and THNF velocity, thermal field, mass concentration, surface drag force (skin friction coefficient), mass, and heat transfer rates were examined.

A multi-objective hybrid optimisation technique is used to determine the optimal composition of nanofluid and operating conditions of the radiator. Design of experiments based on response surface methodology is used to develop regression models for performance parameters such as Peclet number, normalised Nusselt number, Bejan number, and second law efficiency. Further, optimised operating conditions and composition of nanofluid were derived using invasive weed optimisation (IWO) algorithm for the best performance of radiator.

This investigation is performed within the framework of two moving parallel plates under the influence of magnetic field and viscous dissipation. Design/methodology/approach: Due to the complementary benefits of nanoparticles, THN is used to augment the heat transmit fluid’s efficacy. The flow situation is expressed as a system of dimensionless, nonlinear partial differential equations, which are reduced to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by suitable similarity substitutions. These transformed ODEs are then solved through a semianalytical technique called differential transform method (DTM). The effects of several changing physical parameters on the flow, temperature, concentration and the substantial measures of interest have been deliberated through graphs. This study verifies the reliability of the results by performing a comparison analysis with prior researches. Findings: The enhanced activation energy results in improved concentration distribution and declined Sherwood number. Enhancement in chemical reaction parameter causes disparities in concentration of the ternary nanofluid. When the Hartmann number is zero, value of skin friction is high, but Nusselt and Sherwood numbers values are small. Rising nanoparticles concentrations correspond to a boost in overall thermal conductivity, causing reduced temperature profile. Research limitations/implications: Due to its firm and simple nature, its implications are in various fields like chemical industry and medical industry for designing practical problems into mathematical models and experimental analysis. Practical implications: Deployment of the squeezed flow of ternary nanofluid with activation energy has significant consideration in nuclear reactors, vehicles, manufacturing facilities and engineering environments. Social implications: This study would be contributing significantly in the field of medical technology for treating cancer through hyperthermia treatment, and in industrial processes like water desalination and purification. Originality/value: In this problem, a semianalytical approach called DTM is adopted to explore the consequences of activation energy and chemical reactions on the squeezing flow of ternary nanofluid. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Activation Energy;

Darcy's law is used in the study to characterise the permeability and resistance properties of the porous material as it pertains to fluid flow. The vertical wall's non-uniformity is represented by a sine wave, which reflects the surface's wavelike quality. To commence, the system's governing equations are derived, with particular attention paid to the energy conservation equation and the conservation of mass and momentum in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions. These equations combine to create a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that characterise the system's fluid flow and heat transfer dynamics. These governing equations are non-dimensionalized by applying the proper transformations, simplifying the analysis. Non-dimensionalization is a critical step in lowering the number of parameters and simplifying the equations. A similarity transformation transforms the PDEs into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This transformation further reduces the mathematical complexity by taking advantage of the problem's symmetry. The resulting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are then solved using the shooting method, a reliable numerical technique that is well-known for its great precision in solving differential equations. By using this technique, the boundary value problem is changed into an initial value problem, which is frequently simpler to handle.

The impact of the curvature parameter, nanoparticle volume fraction, mixed convection parameter, velocity ratio, shape factor, conjugate number and Eckert number parameters on temperature and velocity profiles has been investigated. Differential equations with partial derivatives were transformed to equations of ordinary differential type. The ODEs were then solved using the RK5th method.

Additionally, employing the ternary hybrid nanofluid (THNF) flow in helical-type heat exchangers to assess the heat transfer and frictional loss is a unique concept, as there is currently no research on this specific application. This study involves analyzing three different design configurations, each of which has three different inlet profiles: round, square, and oval shapes. Hence, a numerical analysis has been conducted on nine cases, each including the same pipe length, helix diameter, and pitch distance. The specified range for the Reynolds number under the water and THNF flow condition is 5000–25000. The results are acquired for both fluids, considering the Nusselt number (Nu), friction factor (f), outlet temperature (Tout), and entropy production (Sg). Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is employed to provide a thorough assessment of the overall performance of the proposed designs. The results have been shown as graphical representations, streamlines and contours where Nusselt number, friction factor and entropy generation have been evaluated.

Therefore, to increase the thermal conductivity, researchers mixed different nanoparticles in the base fluids.

The interaction of three different kinds of nanoparticles, i.e. copper, alumina and silver, is considered with water serving as the base fluid to form a ternary hybrid nanofluid. The paper explores the behavior of ternary hybrid nanofluids on heat and mass transportation phenomena of the two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) micropolar flow across a porous extending surface with zero mass flux and convective conditions.

A two-phase approach considers a liquid phase and a dusty fluid, while a Darcy-Forchheimer law is used to model this fluid flow to capture motion and heat transfer. The several aspects are based on variable thermal radiation, heat sink effects, and slip conditions applied. A tri-hybrid nanofluid comprising silicon dioxide, copper, and aluminum oxide nanoparticles suspended in ethylene glycol, the base fluid, is incorporated into the analysis. The derivation of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is used to characterize momentum, thermal behavior, and fluid motion under these circumstances.

Additionally, the heat transfer coefficient improves from 1.5% to 1.8% across different nanoparticle shapes under varying dissipation parameters.

In this regard, the utilization of liquid-cooled mini-channel heat sinks (MCHSs) and improving their capability for heat dissipation have been considered an effective method in past decades. The current study aims to improve the hydrothermal performance and temperature uniformity of MCHS. To this end, several channel configurations with novel geometrical cross sections, namely basic case and cases 1–4, are designed to investigate the influence of geometrical parameters on the mini-channel performance and temperature distribution inside the heat sink. Moreover, the hydrothermal improvement of each model in comparison to the basic case is computed through a parameter, namely performance evaluation criteria (PEC). Additionally, the impact of employing water-based ternary hybrid nanofluid (THNF) containing TiO2-MgO-GO ternary hybrid nanoparticles (THNPs) with various volume fractions and shape factors (SFs) instead of distilled water in the mini-channel with optimized hydrothermal behavior is thoroughly scrutinized. the outcomes endorse that in case 3 with trapezoidal geometry and PEC parameter equal to 1.2, the Nusselt number improves by 3.2 and 1.3 times, in comparison to case 2 (lowest values of Nusselt number) and base case, at Reynolds number of 831. Also, this is observed that hydraulic diameter directly impacts the pressure drop, and by decrement of that, the pressure drop heightens. However, case 2 with a rhombus geometry results in better temperature uniformity due to its larger effective heat transfer area. Furthermore, it is observed that the volume fraction and SF of THNP significantly affect the hydrothermal behavior of THNF inside the MCHS. For instance, by employing THNF with volume fractions of 0.03 % and 0.05 %, the average heat transfer coefficient (HTC) improves by 9 % and 17 %, pressure drop increases by 220 Pa and 370 Pa, and thermal resistance reduces by 9 % and 25 %, respectively, at Reynolds number of 1496, compared to distilled water. Further, THNF with a volume fraction of 0.05 %, reduces the maximum temperature of the heat sink by 3 K in comparison to distilled water, at a Reynolds number of 831. In addition, the utilization of disparate types of THNP with various SF, including spherical (sf = 3), platelets (sf = 5.7), blades (sf = 8.6), and lamina (sf = 16.1576) is examined and disclosed with volume fraction of 0.05 % and SF of 16.1576 instead of 3, HTC roughly elevates by 67 % and thermal resistance decreases by 47 %, at a Reynolds number of 831. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Geometrical Parameters;

Although nanofluid performance is well appreciate and showed good results in the heat transport phenomena, to further improve conventional base fluids thermal performance an increasing number of researchers have started considering structured nanoparticles suspension in one base fluid. As to make an example, when considering the suspension of three different nanoparticles in a single base fluid we have the so called “ternary hybrid nanofluid”. In the present study three different shaped nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in blood. In particular, the three different shaped nanoparticles are spherical shaped ferric oxide Fe 3O 4, platelet shaped zinc (Zn) , and cylindrical shaped gold (Au) , which are considered in blood base fluid because of related advance pharmaceutical applications. Accordingly, we focused our attention on the sharp evaluation of heat transfer for the unsteady couple stress Casson tri-hybrid nanofluid flow in channel. In particular, we formulated the problem via momentum and energy equations in terms of partial differential equations equipped with realistic physical initial and boundary conditions. Moreover, we transformed classical model into their fractional counterparts by applying the Atangana–Baleanu time-fractional operator.

This is because stagnation point flow is used in many technological applications, such as cooling spinning machinery segments and nuclear reactors. This study analyzes the potential practical applications of the ternary (Cu-Fe3O4-SiO2/SA) hybrid nanofluid as it flows through a stagnation zone of a stretching or shrinking curved surface under the impact of suction and Lorentz force. To acquire numerical solutions, the governing PDEs are first altered into a system of ODEs and then entered into the MATHEMATICA program. We compare findings for validation purposes and illustrate the consequences of specific characteristics that will be planned for the physical quantities that are of interest. When magnetic field and suction are present, velocity improves, but the inverse is true for curvature and nanoparticle volume fraction for both stretching and shrinking surfaces. Temperature increases against nanoparticle volume fraction, magnetic field, and heat source/sink and decreases against suction and curvature parameters for both stretching and shrinking cases.

Utilizing similarity transformations, the resultant flow equations are reduced into non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODE’s).

Nanofluid viscosity was measured over a volume fraction range of VF = 0.25–1.5%, a temperature range of T = 5–55 °C, and a shear rate range of SR = 40–1000 rpm. The preparation of ternary-hybrid nanofluids involved a two-step process, and the nanomaterials were dispersed in SAE 10W40 using a magnetic stirrer and ultrasonic device. In addition, CeO2, GO, and SA nanoadditives underwent X-ray diffraction-based structural analysis. The non-Newtonian (pseudoplastic) behavior of ternary-hybrid nanofluid at all temperatures and volume fractions is revealed by analyzing shear stress, dynamic viscosity, and power-law model coefficients. However, the nanofluids tend to Newtonian behavior at low temperatures. For instance, dynamic viscosity declines with increasing shear rate between 4.51% (at 5 °C) and 41.59% (at 55 °C) for the 1.5 vol% nanofluid. The experimental results demonstrated that the viscosity of ternary-hybrid nanofluid declines with increasing temperature and decreasing volume fraction. For instance, assuming a constant SR of 100 rpm and a temperature increase from 5 to 55 °C, the dynamic viscosity increases by at least 95.05% (base fluid) and no more than 95.82% (1.5 vol% nanofluid).

In connection to this, the convective boundary layer flow of ternary hybrid nanofluid (water-based graphene-CNT-Silver) flow over a curved stretching sheet with activation energy is investigated in this article. In addition, the non-Fourier heat flux model is taken into account. The use of similarity variables transforms the existing partial differential equations into an ordinary differential equation, which is then numerically solved using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg fourth and fifth order (RKF-45) method combined with a shooting approach. The set of graphical results for the significant parameters on thermal, concentration, and velocity profiles is explored. Results reveal that the heat transport in ternary hybrid nanoliquid rises as the thermophoresis and Brownian motion parameters rise. The Biot number influences the thermal profile positively, whereas the increasing Schmidt number and Stefan blowing parameter values reduce mass transport.

The effects of nanoparticles concentration, and the ratio of ZnO and MWCNTs on the optical properties and photothermal conversion performance are experimentally analyzed. Compared to the base fluid (heat transfer oil), the transmittance of the nanofluids decreases with increasing nanoparticle concentration. The ZnO/MWCNTs nanofluids show slightly higher optical absorption performance than MWCNTs due to the multiple scattering caused by the ZnO hierarchical structure.

The Darcy-Forchheimer relation is employed in the momentum equation to examine the influence of porosity. Energy and mass diffusion expressions are obtained by employing the double diffusion theories, which were proposed by Cattaneo and Christov and is broadly used by several researchers. The thermal efficiency of the trihybrid nanocrystals is evaluated by integrating them with a pseudoplastic substrate. The study of titanium dioxide (TiO2), cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), and magnesium oxide (MgO) nanocomposite base hybrid nanofluids across a stretchable sheet is receiving considerable interest in innovation and research due to their extensive spectrum of applicability. For this reason, the phenomena are modeled in the form of a system of PDEs with the effects of a heat source, magnetic field, natural convection, and chemical reaction. Through resemblance substitutions, these are reduced to an ODE system. The resultant first-order differential equations are further processed using the computational approach PCM.

Furthermore, we have devised regression models to forecast the correlation between surface skin friction, thermal heat transmission rate, and dynamic flow parameters. Our results reveal that the increase in magnetic field intensity diminishes the ternary hybrid nanofluid velocity. However, this results in a reversal effect on the ambient temperature of the hybridized fluid. The surface shear stress is more responsive to changes in velocity slippage compared to changes in suction. Similarly, the heat transmission rate is significantly more susceptible to the influence of viscous dissipation than solar radiation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Aluminum Oxide; Finite Difference Method; Friction; Heat Transfer; Matlab; Nanofluidics; Nonlinear Equations; Partial Differential Equations; Shear Flow; Tio2 Nanoparticles; Computational Studies; Energy Conservation Law; Energy Momentum; Heat Transmission; Hybrid Nanofluid; Mass Conservation Law; Nanofluid Flow; Ternary Hybrid; Tio 2; Transmission Rates; Regression Analysis; Titanium Dioxide,Aluminum oxide; Finite difference method; Friction; Heat transfer; MATLAB; Nanofluidics; Nonlinear equations; Partial differential equations; Shear flow; TiO2 nanoparticles; Computational studies; Energy conservation law; Energy momentum; Heat transmission; Hybrid nanofluid; Mass conservation law; Nanofluid flow; Ternary hybrid; TiO 2; Transmission rates; Regression analysis; Titanium dioxide,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014628746,34,"computational study of dissipative ternary hybrid nanofluid flow across a partially slipped-exponentially stretchy surface using numerical and regression analysis this research seeks a computational study of dissipative ternary hybrid nanofluid flow across a partially slipped exponentially stretchy sheet. a ternary hybrid nanofluid is prepared by suspending cu, tio2, and al2o3 nanoparticles in water (h2o). the mathematical model is established based on the underlying assumptions of energy, mass, and momentum conservation laws. the assumed models are represented by interconnected nonlinear partial differential equations that employ a suitable and comparable adjustment. the numerical solution to these equations is evaluated for approximate convergence implementing the lobatto-iiia-bvp4c-algorithm-based solver integrated into the matlab software. this solver is constructed using a finite difference scheme. the implications of relevant evolving parameters on the velocity field (vf), nanoliquid temperature (nt), surface skin friction (ssf), and heat transport rate (htr) are investigated through graphical and tabular representations under slip and no-slip conditions. furthermore, we have devised regression models to forecast the correlation between surface skin friction, thermal heat transmission rate, and dynamic flow parameters. our results reveal that the increase in magnetic field intensity diminishes the ternary hybrid nanofluid velocity. however, this results in a reversal effect on the ambient temperature of the hybridized fluid. the surface shear stress is more responsive to changes in velocity slippage compared to changes in suction. similarly, the heat transmission rate is significantly more susceptible to the influence of viscous dissipation than solar radiation. © 2025 elsevier b.v., all rights reserved. aluminum oxide; finite difference method; friction; heat transfer; matlab; nanofluidics; nonlinear equations; partial differential equations; shear flow; tio2 nanoparticles; computational studies; energy conservation law; energy momentum; heat transmission; hybrid nanofluid; mass conservation law; nanofluid flow; ternary hybrid; tio 2; transmission rates; regression analysis; titanium dioxide aluminum oxide; finite difference method; friction; heat transfer; matlab; nanofluidics; nonlinear equations; partial differential equations; shear flow; tio2 nanoparticles; computational studies; energy conservation law; energy momentum; heat transmission; hybrid nanofluid; mass conservation law; nanofluid flow; ternary hybrid; tio 2; transmission rates; regression analysis; titanium dioxide",Al₂O₃ + Cu + TiO₂,,,

The analysis incorporates the effects of magnetoconvection, radiation, and Joule heating on thermal and fluid dynamics. The Differential Transformation Method is employed to solve the dimensionless governing equations under appropriate initial and boundary conditions. A detailed parametric investigation was conducted to evaluate the influence of key parameters, including the Hartmann number, Reynolds number, Eckert number, nanoparticle volume fraction, skin friction coefficient, and Nusselt number. The results reveal that increasing the Hartmann number reduces the fluid velocity while enhancing the temperature profiles due to intensified Lorentz forces. Elevated Reynolds numbers boost convective heat transfer and flow intensity, while higher nanoparticle volume fractions significantly improve thermal conductivity, leading to higher Nusselt numbers.

The findings of this study offer significant insights into the intricate interplay encompassing electro-osmosis, MHD flow, microorganisms, Joule heating and the ternary hybrid nanofluid. Design/methodology/approach: The governing equations are first non-dimensionalised, and subsequently, a coordinate transformation is used to regularise the irregular boundaries. The discretisation of the governing equations is accomplished by using the Crank–Nicolson scheme. Furthermore, the tri-diagonal matrix algorithm is applied to solve the resulting matrix arising from the discretisation. Findings: The investigation reveals that the velocity profile experiences enhancement with an increase in the Debye–Hückel parameter, whereas the magnetic field parameter exhibits the opposite effect, reducing the velocity profile. A comparative study demonstrates the velocity distribution in Au-CuO hybrid nanofluid and Au-CuO-GO ternary hybrid nanofluid. The results indicate a notable enhancement in velocity for the ternary hybrid nanofluid compared to the hybrid nanofluids. Moreover, an increase in the Brinkmann number results in an augmentation in entropy generation. Originality/value: This study investigates the flow characteristics and entropy analysis in a bifurcated artery system subjected to stenosis, MHD flow and aneurysm conditions. The governing equations are non-dimensionalised, and a coordinate transformation is applied to regularise the irregular boundaries. The Crank–Nicolson scheme is used to model blood flow in the presence of a ternary hybrid nanofluid (Au-CuO-GO/blood) within the arterial domain. The findings shed light on the complex interactions involving stenosis, MHD flow, aneurysms, Joule heating and the ternary hybrid nanofluid. The results indicate a decrease in the wall shear stress (WSS) profile with increasing stenosis size.

This novel class of nanofluids, due to its unique and dynamic thermophysical properties, has diverse applications in numerous arenas of nanotechnology and heat transfer appliances. This research article examines an electrically conducting and magnetically influenced 2D flow of modified hybrid nanofluid past a curved stretching sheet. The considered trihybrid nanofluid contains nanometer sized particles of three different materials (CuO, Al2O3, TiO2) suspended in the water. The preliminary assumptions in this numerical investigation include the exponential heating, Brownian motion, chemical factor, and thermophoresis effects. At boundary, convective mass and heat flux constraints are employed. This pragmatic investigation with the aforementioned presumption is conducted for the first time to evaluate heat and mass transference properties of ternary nanofluid past a curved stretchable surface. The problem is mathematically modelled by using the fundamental momentum and energy equations and modified to cater the solid additives concentration in the base fluid. The modelled Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are subsequently transformed into Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) by employing suitable similarity transformation and subsequently solved by the MATLAB software bvp4c to demonstrate role of important controlling parameters in tabular and graphical form. The research concludes that the enhancement of curvature factor enhances the velocity profile while the impact is opposite for magnetic factor. The most important and an interesting aspect of this innovative study is that the rate of heat transfer increases for all embedding parameters (ie M,K,Nb,Nt,Ec,Δt,β,BiT,BiCandQe), which is the basic purpose of using nanofluids for their promising use in nanotechnology. The study reveals that frictional force at the stretching surface decreases by reducing curvature of surface. However, converse trend is observed for increasing magnetic factor. Moreover, said impact of curvature is more prominent for ternary hybrid nanofluid whereas M has greater impact for unitary nanofluid. The greater heat source factor, activation energy, concentration and thermal Biot numbers, temperature difference and thermophoresis factors increase the concentration boundary layer while decreasing trend is observed for Brownian motion, Schmidt number and chemical reaction factor.

The stability of ternary hybrid nanofluids (THNFs) and size distribution of nanomaterial is obtained through zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) tests. Zeta potential and DLS tests indicated the remarkable stability of the samples with the GO(2): Fe3O4(1): TiO2(1) MR. Analysis of the measurements revealed that the enlargement in temperature and VFs improved the TC of THNFs for all MRs (1:1:1, 2:1:1, 1:2:1, 1:1:2). The highest TC enhancement is observed at the highest temperature (65 °C) and VF (1%), which for the MRs of 1:1:1, 1:1:2, 1:2:1, and 2:1:1 equal to 36.04%, 26.28%, 25.95%, and 33.86%, respectively.

The aim of this paper is to scrutinize the free convection of a ternary hybrid nanosuspension (Al2O3-Ag-CuO/water ternary hybrid nanofluid) in an enclosure with a linearly warming side border. The ternary hybrid nanosuspension motion and energy transfer have been modelled by partial differential equations (PDEs) with appropriate boundary conditions by the single-phase nanofluid model with the Boussinesq approximation. The finite element approach is applied to resolve the control PDEs after transforming them into a dimensionless view. The impact of significant characteristics such as the nanoparticles’ volume fraction, Rayleigh number, and linearly heating temperature constant on the flow and thermal patterns combined with the Nusselt number has been investigated and analyzed using streamlines, isotherms, and other suitable patterns. The performed analysis has shown that the addition of a third kind of nanomaterial allows for intensifying the energy transport within the closed cavity.

The present work aimed to evaluate numerically the first and second law performances of MCHSs using the new cost-effective binary/ternary hybrid nanofluids. Water-based binary and ternary hybrid nanofluids include the MgO/TiO2 nanocomposite and the CuO/MgO/TiO2 nanocomposite, respectively. The effects of the hybrid nanofluid volume concentration (vol.%) and Reynolds number (Re) on the heat transfer, pressure drop, combined thermohydraulic characteristics, and entropy generation characteristics of the MCHSs are discussed. The results show that higher values of the convective heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, and frictional entropy generation rate are obtained when using hybrid nanofluids with high Re and vol.% values.

The highest increment in thermal conductivity as compared to distilled water was obtained for the C type of THNFs at 0.5 solid vol% in 50 °C.

Recently, ternary nanoparticles of different shapes have been combined to generate a unique nanofluid with outstanding thermal characteristics; This work examines the Ternary hybrid nanofluid flow dynamics and the effects of radiation, ambient temperature, and natural convection heat transfer on the transient thermal performance of a porous fin that is rectangular, convex, and triangular, Using Darcy's model, this study creates a heat transport equation, Triangular fin exposed, convex, and rectangular are the three case styles considered while assessing thermal performance. Through the use of PDSolve in the Maple 2024 version program using the finite difference technique, the transformed dimensionless partial equations are solved. Deep Neural Network (LSTM with Adam algorithm) was able to predict the heat transfer rate accurately. By using MATLAB software, the present study model represents the accuracy.

The ANN-based predictive model improves computational efficiency, and it makes the findings highly relevant for applications in environmental pollution control, industrial heat exchangers, and advanced cooling systems. Purpose: The present study investigates the thermal and mass transfer characteristics of a ternary hybrid nanofluid within a magnetically controlled porous medium while accounting for pollutant dispersal. In this study nanofluid with three unique nanoparticles are taken between two parallel sheets and cross mathematical fluid model has been utilized. Furthermore, an inclined magnetic field is incorporated to assess its influence on heat and mass transport dynamics. The thermophoretic velocity effect is considered to examine its role in nanoparticle migration, further impacting pollutant distribution.

After training ANN predicts the solution for different parameters. Findings: Weissenberg number and squeezing parameter reduce velocity due to dominant elastic forces and compression resistance.

The effects of various parameters, including the radiation parameter, Reynolds number and Hartmann number on HT and flow characteristics were analyzed. Analysis of data presents that the Nusselt number increases with higher radiation parameter and falls with higher Hartmann number (Ha), Reynolds number and Eckert number. Furthermore, Nusselt number achieves higher values for Quadratic Thermal Radiation (QTR) case in comparison to Linear Thermal Radiation (LTR). It is observed that when value of radiation parameter is increased from 5.5 to 11.5, the Nusselt number values rises by 216.19% (when Ha = 4), 231.34% (when Ha = 4.5) and 249.82% (when Ha = 5) for LTR, whereas the Nusselt number values rises by 153.68% (when Ha = 4), 157.01% (when Ha = 4.5) and 160.70% (when Ha = 5) for QTR. The applications of the nanofluid flow inside a rotating horizontal annulus are seen in heat exchangers, gas turbines, rotating machinery, cylindrical solar collectors, medical devices like centrifuge and rotating drum dryers in food processing.

In this study, effects of using branching fin on melt fraction of encapsulated PCM in a double vented cavity system which are separated by a thin partition is numerically explored during forced convection of ternary nanofluid. The study is carried out for different values of the Reynolds number (Re, between 200 and 1000), opening ratio (OR between 0.5 and 1.5), branching fin length (between 0.01H and 0.15H), and fin position (sf between 0.15H and 0.3H) by using finite element method. The presence of the branching fin induces vortices near the fin while both thermal performance and melt dynamics are influenced. The increment and decrement amounts of the entire transition time (TR) from Re = 200 to Re = 600 and from Re = 600 to Re = 1000 are 30Â % and 17Â %, respectively. Improvements in thermal performance at the maximum Re of the left and right cavities are 35.3Â % and 58.6Â %, respectively. For maximum heat transfer, the optimum OR value is 1, while for minimal TR, it is 1.75. Reduction in the TR up to 30Â % and thermal performance improvement up to 39Â % can be achieved by varying branching fin length. The average Nu variations with fin placements and the complete transition time are determined to be 20Â % and 49Â %, respectively. Utilizing branching fins at the lowest Re case decreases TR by 21.9Â %, however it is lowered to 41.5Â % at Re = 1000 when the reference scenario without branching fin at Re = 200 is taken into account.

Lorentz force, nanoparticle shape, heat sink/source, non-linear solar radiation, and stretching/shrinking wall effects are considered. A polymer base fluid containing hybrid nanoparticles (i.e., (Formula presented.) nanoparticles) is considered. By utilizing the similarity transformations, the fundamental partial differential equations derived from mathematical modeling are transformed into ordinary differential equations. Thereafter, the computational solution is obtained numerically and analytically. The analytical solution is constructed using an efficient computational technique called the Adomian Decomposition method. To ensure validation, the present results for special cases are compared with those obtained using the Rungeâ€“Kuttaâ€“Fehlberg 4thâ€“5th order (RKF-45) method. The effects of physical factors on velocity, temperature, and entropy generation are shown graphically. Additionally, the impact of multiple variables on the entropy generation number is demonstrated and examined. It is found that the ternary nanofluid velocity boosts with the increase of the Hartmann number, and hence the reversal flow is entirely delayed. Results obtained also reveal that the presence of ternary nanoparticles within base fluid enhances significantly the heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) in both convergent and divergent channels.

This waste heat can have a detrimental effect on engine performance and the climate. By incorporating the nanofluid concept as a waste heat recovery tool into the hollow cylindrical ATEG, we can convert this waste heat into power. The goal of the current study is to determine the best waste recovery method from metallic hybrid and ternary nanofluid at two distinct temperatures, such as 20 and 27 degrees Celsius. The ternary nanofluid employed in this study consists of metallic nanoparticles such as Cu+W+Ag/H2O.

In the framework of electric, magnetic, heat source-sink, and radiation parameters, the study showed that Cu+W+Ag/H2O at 27 degrees Celsius and 20 degrees Celsius maintain a temperature differential across CATEG for increased magnetic and electric field parameters, and in this instance, the metallic hybrid nanofluids have less drag.

These applications specifically focus on addressing the challenge of a cylinder in motion inside a fluid environment. Elevated temperatures may affect the viscosity and thermal conductivity of fluids. Understanding the relationship between temperature and the properties of fluids is crucial. In light of these presumptions, the primary goal of this study is to examine, under transverse magnetic field, shape factor, velocity, thermal slip conditions and viscous dissipation, how temperature-dependent fluid properties could enhance the heat transfer efficiency and performance evolution of ternary hybrid nanofluid. In order to study flow fluctuations, the impact of nanoparticle addition and improvements in heat transfer, a variable Prandtl number is also included. The use of similarity variables converts the controlling flow model from partial differential equations (PDEs) to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Mathematica's shooting strategy solves ODEs using the fourth-order Runge{Kutta (RK-IV) method. Numerical calculations were done after setting parameters to acquire the desired results. Analytical data are provided in tables and graphs for convenient usage. The results showed that the velocity profile increases as the values of Î¦3, Pr, M, Re and S grow, and decreases when the values of Î¸r decrease. Re, Pr and S lower the temperature profile, whereas Î¦3, Î¸r and Ec raise it. The skin friction profile steepens as Î¦3, S, Re and M increase relative to the stretched cylinder, and flattens as Î¸r and ! decrease.

Motivated by these applications, the current investigation computationally analyzes the behavior of magneto-hydrodynamics natural convection inside a porous square cavity, considering the effects of varying magnetic field angles and thermal radiation. The system of equations is changed into non-dimensional form by utilizing appropriate dimensionless variables and is solved by employing the well-established finite difference approach based on the Marker and Cell procedure. This method is utilized to examine the influences of various critical parameters on flow and heat distribution patterns, as well as Nusselt profiles. It provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of physical phenomena that govern the system's flow and thermal behavior. The research specifically focuses on evaluating the heat transmission rate under the influence of thermal radiation.

This article brings attention to investigate the enhanced thermal performance in ternary hybrid nanofluid over a vertical cylinder. The investigation is particularly focused on impact of thermal radiation, infinite shear rate and viscous dissipation in a convective transport of ternary hybrid nanofluid over the vertical cylinder under the influence of MHD consequences. Based on assumptions of current study, the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are formed and then transformed into ODEs for numerical solution. The resulting system of first order equation are numerically solved by bvp4c MATLAB tool. Furthermore, Levenberg-Marquardt neural network (LMNN) artificial neural network procedure (ANN) scheme is utilized. Fluid profile such as velocity and temperature are depicted with effectiveness of some influential physical parameters. The results are interpreted by MATLAB and statistical illustrations.

Regression values are reasonable in different scenarios for all subcases, which reflects the best approximations and demonstrates the linear link between input and output data. The velocity profile of fluid declined with augmentation in numeric values of Weissenberg number. The increasing values of shear rate viscosity parameter intensifies the magnitude of velocity of ternary hybrid nanofluids. Rapid Heat transfer is noted for ternary fluid compared to di-hybrid nanofluids with augmented values of thermal radiation parameter. Mobility of ternary hybrid nanofluids has increased over time for greater values of curvature parameter, which escalates the temperature profile. Slightly improvement in seen in physical quantities for different categories of nanofluids.

Here, water serves as conventional fluid and the nanoparticles are titanium dioxide (TiO2), copper (Cu), and alumina (Al2O3). This work aims to study the flow behaviour for velocity, concentration, and temperature including the novel effects of heat radiation in energy equation and energy activation in concentration equation. Using proper similarity variables, governing equations are transformed to dimension-free form. The bvp4c method is used to solve these nonlinear dimension-free equations numerically. The flow behaviour of various physical parameters is studied graphically for velocity, temperature, and concentration boundary layer. Moreover, considerable importance in this investigation are skin friction coefficient, mass transport rate, and heat transport rate. Observation reveals that Reynolds number and suction parameter enhance fluid velocity and skin friction. Also, fluid velocity in the case of ternary hybrid nanofluid, i.e., for Al2O3â€“Cuâ€“TiO2/H2O enhances than hybrid nanofluid (Al2O3â€“Cu/H2O) and nanofluid (Al2O3/H2O). The temperature profile and heat transport rate are improved by heat sources. Increasing the radiation parameter reduces fluid temperature by 4.76% from ternary to hybrid nanofluid and 4.54% from hybrid to nanofluid.

This study investigates the stagnation point flow of a ternary hybrid nanofluid past a stretching/shrinking sheet, focusing on the influence of the melting parameter and second-order velocity slip. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are initially formulated and subsequently reduced to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs are further transformed into first-order form and numerically solved using the bvp4c solver in MATLAB. Stability analysis is conducted due to the existence of two potential solutions, of which only one proves stable upon analysis. The numerical results indicate significant enhancements in heat transfer performance under conditions of elevated melting and enhanced velocity slip.

Since much of the electricity generated is lost as heat during transportation, energy shortage has become a significant issue for industry in recent years. Minimizing the buildup of entropy during nanofluids flow and heat transmission is essential since heat transfer mechanisms are irreversible, thus the primary goal of this investigation is to investigate the consequences of heat radiation of nanoparticles aggregation and entropy formation on a viscous TiO2-C2H6O2nanofluids via a porous media surface that is exponentially permeable. The flow near the surface experienceÂ convective stagnation. The created PDE was transformed into an ODE, and the synthetic dataset generated is distributed in training (70%), testing (15%), and validation (15%). The stochastic (Levenbergâ€“Marquardt) technique is used to verify the accuracy, validity, and efficiency of the artificial neural networks (ANNs) by testing with regression analysis, mean-squared error (MSE), error histograms, and evaluation relationship between numerical repetitions.

The current study examines a boundary layer two-dimensional inclined magnetohydrodynamic flow of a ternary hybrid nanofluid across a stretching sheet that includes (Formula presented.) nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are combined with water as the base fluid to form a ternary hybrid nanofluid. The present work aims to analyze the impact of several slip conditions utilizing Arrhenius' activation energy along with the binary chemical reaction on the flow profiles. To characterize the model, a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is utilized. With the assistance of similarity transformations, the given PDEs of the form are converted into ordinary differential equations. The leading equations are subjected to boundary layer theory, and then the system is numerically tackled with the help of the built-in numerical approach bvp4c. Results obtained from this numerical solution are presented in graphs and tables which are discussed briefly. The results indicate thatÂ there is a downward trend in the velocity profile if the enhancement occurs in both the velocity slip and the magnetic component. A lower temperature is achieved through the use of the temperature slip parameters.

The working fluid contains nanometer sized spherical shaped particles of three different metals (Formula presented.), which are homogenously and stably dispersed in liquid dihydrogen monoxide as host fluid. A strong magnetic force of strength (Formula presented.) acts along radial direction of curved surface. Thermal radiation term in heat equation suggests a strong heat source in the vicinity. This unique amalgamation, which has not been addressed so far by any researcher incorporates Brownian motion and thermophoresis to construct the hydrothermal framework. The passive control of nanoparticles on surface influenced by Brownian movement and thermophoresis, which is considered more realistic in comparison to constant concentration hypothesis (active control), have been taken into account. The nanoliquid flow is governed by system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that cater thermophysical properties of nanoparticles. After simplifying the system to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using suitable transform, it is solved numerically using bvp4c in MATLAB 2023a. The obtained graphical and numerical results are discussed in detail to explain physics of observed thermo-rheological behaviour and mass diffusivity. The study reveals that curvature and porosity factors have opposite effects on velocity profile. All involved parameters augment temperature profile for both active and passive controls except curvature factors. In all the cases, active control assures higher temperature over passive control. Dual consequences have been noted for active and passive controls for concentration panels in most cases. Nusselt number is found increasing for increasing nanoparticles concentration with ternary nanofluid having maximum heat transfer rate.

A third-generation heat transfer fluid, known as modified hybrid nanofluids (MHNs), has recently emerged, created through the synthesis of ternary nanomaterials and the base fluid. This new class of fluids demonstrates enhanced effectiveness over simple nanofluids in a variety of engineering and industrial applications. Thus, the current analysis concentrates on a thorough investigation that employs modified versions of Fickâ€™s and Fourierâ€™s laws to explore a variety of scientific ideas in a synergistic manner, including magnetohydrodynamics, micropolar trihybrid nanofluids, second-grade fluids, and stagnation point flow. Additionally, the effects of thermal radiation, activation energy, viscous dissipation, and double stratification are considered. The study goes on to use the modified versions of Fourierâ€™s and Fickâ€™s principles, which offer a thorough foundation for comprehending heat-mass communication in such complex systems. By using suitable similarity variables, the flow model equations are converted into their non-dimensional forms. These non-dimensional equations are then numerically solved through the BVP4C technique implemented in MATLAB. Results are produced both numerically and graphically, and they are analyzed for different emergent dimensionless parameters.

The porous medium Darcy Forchheimer effect is included in the momentum equation. Through the effects of melting, the process of heat transfer is described. In order to explore the features of heat transmission in the absenteeism of LTECs (local thermal equilibrium conditions), the current study employs a mathematical model that has been simplified. For both the solid and liquid phases, the LTNE model yields two different fundamental thermal gradients. This proposed model compares the YOM (Yamada-Ota model) and XM (Xue model), two well-known trihybrid nanofluid models, in terms of performance. After applying the proper transformations, modulated non-linear PDEs (partial differential equations) are simplified in ODEs (ordinary differential equations) and the bvp4c method is used to solve them numerically. A graphic discussion of the relevant factors' significance on the pertinent fields has been presented.

Particularly ternary hybrid nanofluids have shown promise as a means of improving the systems' electrical and thermal performance. This study delves deeply into the exploration of a three-dimensional annulus-type Photovoltaic Thermal (PV/T) system, centering on its cooling function through the utilization of ternary hybrid nanofluids featuring diverse nanomaterial shapes. The system structure involves a circular cylinder enveloped within glass, silicon, and copper layers, forming the core of the PV panel. The investigation employs COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0 with boundary conditions like radiative heat flux on the upper domain. Nanofluids with varied shapes (spherical, brick-like, cylindrical, platelet, and blade-shaped) comprising copper, aluminum oxide, and micro-wall carbon Nanotubes suspended in water are scrutinized as the base fluid. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, our simulation employs a conjugate heat transfer interface to solve the intricate three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and energy equations, addressing the combined convection challenges in the system. Analyzing parameters such as Reynolds number (100â€“1500), aspect ratios (0.1, 0.15, 0.2), shape factors (3â€“8.9), and total volume fractions of nanomaterials (1%â€“10 %), we noted a significant decline (21â€“28 %) in the average Nusselt number as nanoparticle concentration increased. This trend highlights strengthened convection processes, notably observable with increased flow pipe diameter or aspect ratio. This decrease suggests that the system's convective heat transfer efficiency has decreased. Nonetheless, because the PV cells are better cooled, the decrease in convective heat transfer is accompanied by an increase in the electrical efficiency of the system. The practical implication of this trend is that even though the thermal performance in terms of heat removal may decline, the overall cooling effect still helps to keep the PV cells' temperature down, thereby raising their electrical output. The study revealed enhanced electrical efficiency (up to 9.3834 %) with blade-shaped particles under specific conditions: Re = 1500, 10 % volume fraction, and an aspect ratio of 0.1. Additionally, the investigation suggests a potential for achieving a maximum thermal efficiency of 85.62 %. These findings underline the promising impact of nanomaterial manipulation on both electrical and thermal efficiencies within the PV/T system while the maximum temperature at the outlet reaced to 5.470 C.

We used a ternary hybrid nanofluid, Blood contains three types of oxides and metals: spherical ferric oxide (Fe3O4), platelet-shaped zinc (Zn), and cylindrically-shaped gold (Au) nanoparticles. The coupled nonlinear dual partial differential equations (PDEs) are turned into PDEs using nondimensional quantities. The Finite Difference Method (FDM) and the Perturbation Method are then used to solve the PDEs. The impacts of different parameters on temperature, velocity, Nusselt number, and Skin friction profiles have been discussed. The increase in viscosity occurs because an increase in Gr also causes an increase in the velocity field for nanofluid, hybrid, and tri-hybrid nanofluids. A tri-hybrid nanofluids performs better among the three, such as nanofluid, hybrids and tri-hybrid nanofluids. As the volume fractions (Fe3O4) increase, the temperature increase for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The increase in temperature is due to the thermal conductivity of nanoparticles, which is enhanced by growth estimates of the nanoparticle volume fraction. The high temperature of the fluid is observed for large estimates of nanoparticle volume fraction. An increase gold (Au) also increases the temperature for shapes (cylinder, platelet, and spherical).

Concurrently, the study of flow dynamics through a stretching cylinder assumes paramount importance within contemporary construction paradigms, spanning the realms of polymer processing, metal sheet manipulation, biomechanics, and advanced medical applications. Bolstering these pragmatic contexts, the ongoing inquiry is focused on scrutinizing the reverberations of thermal radiation upon the laminar Cross model flow, ensconced within a magnetized ternary hybrid nanofluid. This, in turn, reverberates through the intricate tapestry of heat transfer phenomena. The fluidic flux is orchestrated by a stratified stretching cylinder, ensconced within the labyrinthine confines of a porous medium. The research intricately highlights pivotal attributes of the fluid, encompassing its intricately temperature-tethered thermal conductivity and its hinging upon the nuanced orchestra of temperature distribution. Furthermore, it cast an illuminating spotlight on the incipient cascades of ohmic heating, significantly sculpting the heat exchange contours within fluidic streams. The controlling equations are turned into dimensionless partial differential equations via non-similarity transformations. subsequently, the local non-similarity approach is utilized to treat the dimensionless PDEs as ODEs, and bvp4c MATLAB tools are used to effectively solve them. Subsequently, graphical representations are provided to illustrate the changes in the velocity profile and temperature profile resulting from variations in parameters such as the Weissenberg number, porous parameter, thermal conductivity parameter, Magnetic parameter, and Eckert number. Under the given physical circumstances, the Nusselt number representing the temperature gradient and the local skin friction coefficient were determined. Notably, the heat transport mechanism is significantly affected by both thermal radiation and ohmic heating.

The Reynolds number is chosen between 13,000 and 28,000. The nanoparticle volume fraction of Zn:Ag:Co/EG-H2O is 1.0%. When corrugations are added, the flow and temperature fields change significantly, which improves heat transfer. This is shown by comparing the results of the corrugated cases with those of the cases without corrugations. The results indicate that when using a smooth pipe with EG-H2O fluid, the Nusselt number rises by 24.53%, 51.77%, and 92.67% at Reynolds numbers of 18,000, 23,000, and 28,000, respectively, compared to that at a Reynolds number of 13,000.

The Nusselt number values for the decreasing wall corrugation, increasing wall corrugation, and non-uniform wall corrugation pipes are notably higher than those for the smooth pipe with EG-H2O.

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of heat and mass transfer of the ternary hybrid nanofluid flow (THNF), which is squeezed between two parallel plates, using ANN. The plate which lies on x-axis is stretching while the upper plate (UP) can move in upward and downward direction. An inclined magnetic field (MF) is also applied to the lower plate (LP). A system of partial differential equations of flow, energy, and mass transfer is used to simulate the THNF, which is then condensed using similarity substitution to a collection of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Using the differential transform method (DTM), the resultant nonlinear ODEs in dimensionless form are further solved. The influence of the different varying physical parameters on velocity, temperature, and concentration is graphically presented and discussed. It becomes apparent that the velocity, heat, and mass transfer in squeezing flows are significantly impacted by the inclination angle of the applied MF. To demonstrate the validity of the study, the numerical findings of the Nusselt and the Sherwood numbers are provided. For the accuracy of the used approach, DTM results are compared with results from the numerical approach. The novelty of the current work is to train the neural network with the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm in the model. To get the estimated output of the model, different scenarios are set for training, testing, and validation. The analysis is done by mean square error (MSE), histogram, fitness curve, and regression (RG).

Also, It can describe the demeanor of a vast field of actual fluids. This achieved a significant turn in the enhancement of heat transfer that improves manufacturing and engineering modernization. Depending on that, the assumptions that form our aims are numerically examining energy transport and heat transfer via Casson ternary hybrid nanofluids that contain the states of combined convection flow over a vertical stretching sheet. Also, Newtonian heating boundary conditions and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effects are investigated. Mathematical models (governing equations) that emulate and construct the conduct of these boosted ternary hybrid nanofluids are formed by developing the Tiwari and Das models. These governing equations are converted to partial differential equations (PDEs) employing appropriate substitutions. An accurate and efficient method called the Keller box numerical method is executed to get outcomes to the physical model. These numerical calculations are found and presented by employing MATLAB codes, to acquire tables of numerical outcomes, and graphic exhibits, which provide the impacts of important parameters on the physical quantities supporting heat transfer. Furthermore, the new results, in the Newtonian fluid case, were compared with prior literature, which were in excellent agreement. The studied problem parameters are examined at a Casson parameter domain of 1 to 5, a mixed convection parameter domain of-1 to 3, a conjugate parameter of 0.2 to 1, a magnetic parameter domain of 0.1 to 5, and a nanoparticle volume fraction parameter of 0.001 to 0.008. The numerical consequences deduced that the local skin friction rises when the conjugate and mixed convection parameters are increased.

On a stretching sheet with a convective boundary condition, the investigation was conducted. Model equations with boundary conditions were transformed into a set of ODEs in order to study the flow. The resulting system of equations was solved by using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method in conjunction with the shooting method. A numerical analysis was done to determine the impact of several key factors on the system's heat transfer characteristics and flow field velocity. Computed the flow field's velocity and heat transfer properties by varying these physical parameters, then graphically displayed the results. Additionally, tables covered the local shear stress and rate of heat transfer respectively, describe the flow's resistance to motion and the rate of local heat transfer of ternary hybrid nanofluid. For a thorough comparison, the results were compiled in tables.

Infinitely renewable examples include solar and wind energy. There are many sources of clean energy all around us. Motive behind current study: A framework has now been developed throughout this research to investigate the impact of the sun's rays on novel Xue tetra hybrid magnetized cross nano-liquid as it moves through an expanding sheet inside that PV sheet of a solar module installed on top of such an offshore solar oil field. A novel Xue tetra hybrid nanofluid model has been developed and utilized to explore the impact of tetrahybrid nanoparticles on liquid flowing in order to investigate heat transport analysis. By directing the liquid's motion through a magnetic field, we may examine its velocity impact. The concentration aspect of nanofluid has been examined by including homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical processes, and indeed, the temperature accessibility of cross-nanofluid is obtained by taking into consideration effects like thermal conductivity and thermal radiation. Technique: The PDEs derived from the working prototype are then subjected to the resemblance factors, yielding the ODEs. The bvp4c scheme is used to get numerical results. The procedure is an ODE solver that belongs to the Runge-Kutta family. In order to provide precise answers in the fourth and fifth orders, it performs six function evaluations. The discrepancy between them is therefore interpreted as the solution's (fourth-order) inaccuracy. Adaptive stepsize integration techniques greatly benefit from this error estimation. Fehlberg's (RKF) integration strategy is quite similar to Cash and Carp technique. Significant finding: From obtained results, it is detected that the addition of novel tetrahybrid nanoparticles in the conventional liquid (Xue tetrahybrid nanofluid) enhances heat transfer rate and temperature profile more quickly in contrast to conventional ternary hybrid nanofluid and dihybrid nanofluid available in the existing literature. The thing which makes the present work novel and one step ahead in contrast to existing available literature is the development and implementation of a tetrahybrid nanofluid model in contrast to conventional ternary hybrid and dihybrid nanofluid models. Tetra hybridity nanoliquid generates extra heat in distinction to already existing ternary hybridity and dihybrid nanofluid models and more heat is absorbed by PV sheets in the existence of tetrahybrid nanoparticles. Conclusions: When the nanomaterials are submerged inside this liquid, their temperature increases throughout both the shear thinning and shear thickening cases. This is because the homogeneous chemical reaction mimics the migration of nanoparticles within the liquid. The increased magnetic force, in addition to an enhancement of Lorentz's force, slows down the nanofluid motion. The increased volume percentage of tetrahybrid nanoparticles, thermal radiation, and thermal conductivity boost the heat that's captured by a PV sheet, and that heat is utilized for other functions, such as drilling or navigation, on that solar offshore rig. Cost analysis: Cost analysis has also been presented in terms of Pakistan offshore oil rigs in terms of solar panels and diesel generators and it is observed that 49% cost is reduced if we replaced offshore oil rigs with solar-powered energy.

The thermal scientists and scholars considered nanofluid in their research due to its useful applications in different thermal systems. But nanofluid still not enough for the required thermal transport properties. Therefore, the researchers tried to disperse two or more than two nanoparticles which are called hybrid and tri-hybrid nanofluid. It was tested experimentally that these hybrid nanofluids are more efficient fluids in different cooling systems compared to nanofluid and regular fluids. The present article carried out the research about the suspension of three different kinds of nanoparticles in various shapes for advance cooling applications in industries and engineering problems. The three nanoparticles are cylindrical carbon nanotubes (Figure presented.), spherical aluminum oxide (Figure presented.), and platelet shaped(Graphene) are mixed in water flowing in a rotating disk. This advance fluid has remarkable enhancement in the heat transfer rate in comparison with regular fluid, mono nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid. In this study viscoelastic radiative ternary hybrid nanofluid is considered on a rotating disk. The solutions are obtained by using the HAM method. For physical interpretation, all the flow parameters are discussed through graphs. The impact of volume fraction on the flow and heat transfer is also evaluated and presented in graphs. From the comparison, it was declared that tri-hybrid nanofluid has the best thermal performance compared to hybrid and mono nanofluid. Furthermore, radiation increases the temperature of the fluid, while viscoelastic parameter decreases the radial and tangential velocity. From the present study, we noticed that by considering the tri-hybrid mixture in water, the rate of heat transfer can be enhanced up to 33.69%.

A mathematical model which includes heat, velocity, and concentration profile is obtained and is converted into dimensionless equations by mean of various different parameters. Fractional model based on generalized Fourier and Fick's law are considered in order to address the accurate memory concept of the flow problem. For analytical solutions, Prabhakar fractional operator is utilized to get results for energy, velocity, and concentration field. The effect of various parameters involved is shown with the help of graph by assigning different values to parameters.

The ternary hybrid nanoliquid with MHD has a lot of engineering and industrial applications. In polymer data processing, cone and wedge geometries are frequently utilized. Therefore, the present problem is designed to the flow of ternary hybrid nanoliquid over multiple geometries. Hybrid nanoliquids performed well in the heat transport rate as compared to the nanoliquid and conventional liquid. Here in this study, the idea of ternary hybrid nanoliquid is introduced to improve the energy and mass transmissions which show more satisfactory results in the thermal and mass transmission performance. The impacts of chemical reaction and thermal radiation are also executed in this model. The formulation of the present study is performed in the form of PDEs which are then transformed into the ODEs by using suitable similarity transformations. The homotopic analysis scheme is implemented for the semi-analytical solution of the existing model. Some major results that materialize from the present simplification are that; the tri-hybrid nanoliquid velocity is greater for the rising nanoparticles volume fractions. The enlargement in radiation parameter enlarged the tri-hybrid nanoliquid thermal profile.

This study investigates the thermal and hydrodynamic characteristics of ternary hybrid nanofluids consisting of silica, cadmium selenide quantum dots, and copper, immersed in ethanol for Hiemenz and Homann flows induced normal to the oncoming stagnation point flow. The flow is induced over an infinite plate in a porous medium, and is moving (at a constant velocity) towards/receding from normal stagnation point flow. The flow is driven due to porosity, magnetic effects, and Reynolds number, (where Reynolds number is proportional to the constant velocity of the moving plate).

Objective: The present study proposes a novel mathematical model for the ternary hybrid cross bio-nanofluid model to analyse the behaviour of blood that passes through a stenosed artery under the influence of an inclined magnetic field. The model considers the effect of expanding/contracting cylinder, infinite shear rate viscosity, and bio-nanofluids. Methodology: The considered model of the problem is bounded in the form of governing equations such as PDEs. These PDEs are transformed into ODEs with the help of similarity transformations and then solved numerically with the help of the bvp4c method. Findings: The results show that the flow rate and velocity decrease as the inclination angle of the magnetic field increases. Additionally, research has found that the presence of nanoparticles in the bio-nanofluid has a significant impact on the velocity and flow rate. Therefore, the flow rate decreases, in general, as the stenosis becomes more severe.

Ternary hybrid nanofluid is the colloidal mixture of three district types of particles, namely, Al203, single-wall CNT, and graphene. The ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the equation is yielded by converting partial differential equations (PDEs) with the help of suitable variables for analyzing the spherical, cylindrical, and platelet nanoparticles. Then the analytical solution can be conducted by using different shapes of the nanoparticles, namely, spherical, cylindrical, and platelet, to get the solution domain. Main results on the applications of suction and results of four roots are investigated. Also by using this domain fluctuation of friction, heat and mass transfer across the flow can be analyzed with various physical parameters. Increasing knowledge of these ternary hybrid nanofluids helps to improve the heat transfer rate. This is useful in dynamics of fuel and coolant in automobiles. Furthermore, the goal and novelty of the present work mainly explains the ternary hybrid nanofluid flow with three different shapes of nanoparticles in the presence of mixed convection. The given mixed convective Navierâ€“Stokes equations given in PDE form are converted into ODE form using suitable transformation. The analytical results are expressed in terms of Prandtl number and in terms of four roots. Finally, the impact of different shapes of nanoparticles and parameters can be discussed using a graphical scenario. The main finding is that the Dufour number is greater for more values of thermal radiation. Also, transverse and tangential velocities as well as temperature and concentration profiles are greater for more values of solution domain and Darcy number.
